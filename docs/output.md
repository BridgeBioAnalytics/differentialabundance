# nf-core/differentialabundance: Output

## Introduction

This document describes the output produced by the pipeline. Most of the plots are taken from a report produced using RMarkdown, which summarises results at the end of the pipeline.

The directories listed below will be created in the results directory after the pipeline has finished. All paths are relative to the top-level results directory.

## report

This directory contains the main reporting output of the workflow.

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `report/`
  - `*.html`: an HTML report file named according to the value of `params.study_name`, containing graphical and tabular summary results for the workflow run.

</details>

## Plots

Stand-alone graphical outputs are placed in this directory. They may be useful in external reporting, publication preparation etc. 

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `plots/`
  - `qc/`: Directory containing quality control plots from initial processinge.g. DESeq2 
  - `exploratory/`: Directory containing standalone plots from exploratory analysis    
  - `differential/`: Directory containing standalone plots from differential analysis
  - `gsea/`: Directory containing graphical outputs from GSEA (where enabled)

</details>

## Tables

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `tables/`
  - `processed_counts/`: Directory containing processed counts from initial processing from e.g. DESeq2 
  - `differential/`: Directory containing tables of differential statistics reported by differential modules such as DESeq2.   
  - `gsea/`: Directory containing tables of differential gene set analyis from GSEA (where enabled)

### Pipeline information

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `pipeline_info/`
  - Reports generated by Nextflow: `execution_report.html`, `execution_timeline.html`, `execution_trace.txt` and `pipeline_dag.dot`/`pipeline_dag.svg`.
  - Reports generated by the pipeline: `pipeline_report.html`, `pipeline_report.txt` and `software_versions.yml`. The `pipeline_report*` files will only be present if the `--email` / `--email_on_fail` parameter's are used when running the pipeline.
  - Reformatted samplesheet files used as input to the pipeline: `samplesheet.valid.csv`.

[Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/tracing.html) provides excellent functionality for generating various reports relevant to the running and execution of the pipeline. This will allow you to troubleshoot errors with the running of the pipeline, and also provide you with other information such as launch commands, run times and resource usage.
